Hi, Joshua here!

Assuming you just downloaded Time Track you are on your way to *insert unrealistic expectations here*. 
In all seriousness though thanks for trying out my program. 


Question: What is Time Track?

Answer: Time Track is a program I wrote primarily for All American Concrete Inc. It is designed to document
	the work of employees and to be able to track how long they have worked on projects and sub-projects.
	

Question: What is the purpose?

Answer: Well with all that data available at our fingertips we will be able to easy predict how much 
	these same sub-projects will cost in the future. On top of that we will be able to see where 
	money is being wasted, and cut back.


Question: How do I get started?

Answer: Unless you work for All American Concrete Inc. You probably don't have access to our local network. 
	Unfortunately getting on this network is required to use Time Track. This is because the MySql data-
	base is hosted on my workstation. Hopefully in the future there will be web hosting! But assuming you
	are connected all you have to do is double click the .exe file in the Deployment folder.


Question: How do I log in?

Answer: You can log in by entering in your pin number and depending on your privilege a menu will show up.
	If you are by chance an admin you can press the right hand button(the one with the graph) and it will
	take you to the analysis page.


From there you can fill out the program with employees you have and progects you want completed. 

There is a video detailing how to use the program on my website(joshuawootonn.com) you will find this 
project under projects and c++. Also feel free to contact me at joshuawootonn@gmail.com

Cheers!
Josh
