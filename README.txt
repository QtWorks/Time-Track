Hi, Joshua here!

Assuming you just downloaded Time Track you are on your way to *insert unrealistic expectations here*. 
In all seriousness though thanks for trying out my program. 


Question: What is Time Track?

Answer: Time Track is a program I wrote primarily for All American Concrete Inc. It is designed to document
	the work of employees and to be able to track how long they have worked on projects and sub-projects.
	

Question: What is the purpose?

Answer: Well with all that data available at our fingertips we will be able to easy predict how much 
	these same sub-projects will cost in the future. On top of that we will be able to see where 
	money is being wasted, and cut back.


Question: How do I get started?

Answer: Unless you work for All American Concrete Inc. You probably don't have access to our local network. 
	In that case what you are going to do is open up the folder called /Deployment. In there you will see
	Time Track.exe with the Time Track Logo. If you are connected to the local network above Time Track will 
	connect automatically. Otherwise a file selector will come up and you can select data.sqlite within
	/SQLite/clean or /SQLite/working. At this point you are connected!


Question: How do I log in?

Answer: If you connected to the 
	*	/clean version you have two employees preset 'admin' and 'employee.'
		Log into these accounts with '1111' and '2222' respectively.
	* 	/working version you have many employees but I would recomment 
		logging in as 'joshua wootonn' by entering '5656'.


Question: What if I want to change my connection?
	
Answer: Now that you are connected you can login to any admin level account and from there click the advanced
	button. This is where most of the analysis will take place. Click on 'Database' tab and from there click 
	the 'connect' button. That will open a file selection dialog. At this point you have a couple of options. 
	you can copy the /clean/data.sqlite or the /working/data.sqlite file to somewhere on your network or
	computer and then select it from this dialog, or you can simply leave it where it is and just switch the 
	between the working copy and clean copy versions. Whatever you do dont move the /setup folder. 

From there you can fill out the program with employees you have and progects you want completed. 

From there is a video detailing how to use the program on my website(joshuawootonn.com) you will find this 
project under projects and c++. Also feel free to contact me at joshuawootonn@gmail.com

Cheers!
