# Time Track

### About
Time Track is a program I wrote primarily for All American Concrete Inc. It is designed to document
the work of employees and to be able to track how long they have worked on projects and sub-projects.
	

### Purpose
Well with all that data available at our fingertips we will be able to easy predict how much 
these same sub-projects will cost in the future. On top of that we will be able to see where 
money is being wasted, and cut back.


### Usage 
1. Download the zip
2. Extract it
3. Import the `Time-Track-master/Database/clean_database.sql` 	into your local mysql database
4. Click on `Time-Track-master/Deployment/Time.exe`  
5. Fill in the database parameters that you just specified in 	your mysql database
6. Now that you are at the login screen enter 1111 

And you are in BINGO :)
